      We’re building the most advanced home energy intelligence platform ever offered to everyday people — and we’re giving it away for free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelliwatt is designed to help you truly understand how your home uses energy — and how to make smarter, cheaper, cleaner choices every single day. No tricks. No pressure. Just powerful tools made for real households.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is bold: to shift the power back to consumers and help millions save money through clarity, data, and intelligent energy automation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as a way to help Texans lower their electric bills is quickly becoming something much bigger — a full-stack platform for real energy independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The future of home energy is coming. And it's being built for you.
